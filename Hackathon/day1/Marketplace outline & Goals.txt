Marketplace Type Choice: Rental E-Commerce
Primary Purpose: I’ve chosen Rental E-Commerce as the marketplace type for my business, which focuses on renting gaming consoles (PlayStation, Xbox) and accessories (controllers, VR headsets) to gatherings like family or friends get-togethers. The core aim is to make these events memorable by offering an affordable and convenient way to rent high-quality gaming experiences, without the need for long-term ownership.

We aim to make gaming experiences accessible, affordable, and stress-free for events like birthday parties, family reunions, and friends' hangouts.
